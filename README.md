# FluidSimulation
Built from the ground up in C++ using some openGL, this code can be run to simulate a drop of a fluid falling into a pool. With very little effort it can be modified to simulate any other initial set up of liquid and solid placement in a rectangular prism as the boundaries.

Attached is a video product of over 400 frames at 24 frames per second created from the simulation. Each time step is 1ms (giving the simulation a ~3x slow-mo effect), and each frame took ~1sec to render.
